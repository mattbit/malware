	abstract = {Botnets are used for various purposes, most of them related to illegitimate activity, being also the sources of massive exploit activity as they recruit new vulnerable systems to expand their reach. Due to their volume, diverse capabilities and robustness, botnets pose a significant and growing threat to enterprise networks and to the Internet itself. Detecting botnets is a hard task and traditional network security systems are unable to successfully complete it. In fact, botnets are evolving and can be quite flexible: the protocols used for Command and Control (C\&C) evolved from traditional {IRC} to others and the structure moved from centralized to distributed, using for example the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) communication paradigm. So, new generation botnet detection systems should be independent of the C\&C protocol, botnet structure, infection model and resilient to the change of C\&C server addresses. In addition, they should use all available information (from network probes, servers, routing elements, traffic statistics, identification of illicit applications), correlating it in the most useful way. Characterizing existing botnets is crucial to design and efficient detection methodology. Several approaches can be taken to study this phenomenon: analyze its source code, which can be a hard task mainly due to license restrictions; study of the botnet control, particularly the activity of its C\&C server(s); study of the botnet behavior, namely its possible scanning activities, Denial of Service ({DoS}) attacks, spamming or phishing activities, among other possibilities. This work will mainly use the last two approaches to characterize (i) the traffic generated by each bot when communicating with the C\&C server(s) and (ii) identify and analyze the main patterns of the botnet generated traffic.},

This paper describes the design and implementation of {NetProbe}, a system that we propose for solving this problem. {NetProbe} models auction users and transactions as a Markov Random Field tuned to detect the suspicious patterns that fraudsters create, and employs a Belief Propagation mechanism to detect likely fraudsters. Our experiments show that {NetProbe} is both eﬃcient and eﬀective for fraud detection. We report experiments on synthetic graphs with as many as 7,000 nodes and 30,000 edges, where {NetProbe} was able to spot fraudulent nodes with over 90\% precision and recall, within a matter of seconds. We also report experiments on a real dataset crawled from {eBay}, with nearly 700,000 transactions between more than 66,000 users, where {NetProbe} was highly eﬀective at unearthing hidden networks of fraudsters, within a realistic response time of about 6 minutes. For scenarios where the underlying data is dynamic in nature, we propose Incremental {NetProbe}, which is an approximate, but fast, variant of {NetProbe}. Our experiments prove that Incremental {NetProbe} executes nearly doubly fast as compared to {NetProbe}, while retaining over 99\% of its accuracy.},

	abstract = {In this work we show that once a single peer-to-peer (P2P) bot is detected in a network, it may be possible to eﬃciently identify other members of the same botnet in the same network even before they exhibit any overtly malicious behavior. Detection is based on an analysis of connections made by the hosts in the network. It turns out that if bots select their peers randomly and independently (i.e. unstructured topology), any given pair of P2P bots in a network communicate with at least one mutual peer outside the network with a surprisingly high probability. This, along with the low probability of any other host communicating with this mutual peer, allows us to link local nodes within a P2P botnet together. We propose a simple method to identify potential members of an unstructured P2P botnet in a network starting from a known peer. We formulate the problem as a graph problem and mathematically analyze a solution using an iterative algorithm. The proposed scheme is simple and requires only ﬂow records captured at network borders. We analyze the eﬃcacy of the proposed scheme using real botnet data, including data obtained from both observing and crawling the Nugache botnet.},

Our method, which is based on the belief propagation algorithm, is efficient, naturally distributed, and exact on trees. As a particular case, we consider the problem of finding the “zero patient” of a susceptible-infected-recovered or susceptible-infected epidemic given a snapshot of the state of the network at a later unknown time. Numerical simulations show that our method outperforms previous ones on both synthetic and real networks, often by a very large margin.},

This paper compares the output of three different botnet detection methods by executing them over a new, real, labeled and large botnet dataset. This dataset includes botnet, normal and background trafﬁc. The results of our two methods ({BClus} and {CAMNEP}) and {BotHunter} were compared using a methodology and a novel error metric designed for botnet detections methods.

Considering the characteristics of web malware, a new differential epidemic model which extends the traditional {SIR} model by adding another delitescent compartment is proposed to address the spreading behavior of malicious links over networks. The spreading threshold of the model system is calculated, and the dynamics of the model is theoretically analyzed. Moreover, the optimal control theory is employed to study malware immunization strategies, aiming to keep the total economic loss of security investment and infection loss as low as possible. The existence and uniqueness of the results concerning the optimality system are confirmed. Finally, numerical simulations show that the spread of malware links can be controlled effectively with proper control strategy of specific parameter choice.},

	abstract = {Malware attacks constitute a serious security risk that threatens to slow down the large-scale proliferation of wireless applications. As a first step toward thwarting this security threat, we seek to quantify the maximum damage inflicted on the system due to such outbreaks and identify the most vicious attacks. We represent the propagation of malware in a battery-constrained mobile wireless network by an epidemic model in which the worm can dynamically control the rate at which it kills the infected node and also the transmission ranges and/or the media scanning rates. At each moment of time, the worm at each node faces the following tradeoffs: 1) using larger transmission ranges and media scanning rates to accelerate its spread at the cost of exhausting the battery and thereby reducing the overall infection propagation rate in the long run; or 2) killing the node to inflict a large cost on the network, however at the expense of losing the chance of infecting more susceptible nodes at later times. We mathematically formulate the decision problems and utilize Pontryagin Maximum Principle from optimal control theory to quantify the damage that the malware can inflict on the network by deploying optimum decision rules. Next, we establish structural properties of the optimal strategy of the attacker over time. Specifically, we prove that it is optimal for the attacker to defer killing of the infective nodes in the propagation phase until reaching a certain time and then start the slaughter with maximum effort. We also show that in the optimal attack policy, the battery resources are used according to a decreasing function of time, i.e., most aggressively during the initial phase of the outbreak. Finally, our numerical investigations reveal a framework for identifying intelligent defense strategies that can limit the damage by appropriately selecting network parameters.},

The introduced formulation is used to identify and evaluate different attack strategies and approaches. Through modelling and simulation, we evaluate the impact of various parameters associated with the operational characteristics of the mobile attacker on an outbreak spreading and the network evolution.

Due to its nature the model is able to deal more effectively with the stochastic behavior of the attacker and the inherent probabilistic nature of the wireless environment. The proposed model is able to describe accurately the asymptotic behavior of malware-propagative ad hoc networking environments, where the number of nodes is large.

We suggest that website popularity may be a universal property of Internet.},

countries, and the most wealthy billionaires, can be all described in terms of
Zipf’s Law, a rank-size rule capturing the relation between the frequency of a
set of objects or events and their size. It is assumed to be one of many
manifestations of an underlying power law like Pareto’s or Benford’s,
but contrary to popular belief, from a distribution of, say, city sizes and a simple
random sampling, one does not obtain Zipf’s law for the largest cities. This
pathology is reflected in the fact that Zipf’s Law has a functional form
depending on the number of events N. This requires a fundamental property of
the sample distribution which we call ‘coherence’ and it corresponds to
a ‘screening’ between various elements of the set. We show how it should
be accounted for when fitting Zipf’s Law.},

Previously we proposed the Beta rank function to improve the fitting of data which does not follow a perfect Zipf’s law. Here we show that when the two parameters in the Beta rank function have the same value, the Lavalette rank function, the probability density function can be derived analytically. We also show both computationally and analytically that Lavalette distribution is approximately equal, though not identical, to the lognormal distribution. We illustrate the utility of Lavalette rank function in several datasets. We also address three analysis issues on the statistical testing of Lavalette fitting function, comparison between Zipf’s law and lognormal distribution through Lavalette function, and comparison between lognormal distribution and Lavalette distribution.},

	abstract = {Malicious domains are one of the major resources required for adversaries to run attacks over the Internet. Due to the important role of the Domain Name System ({DNS}), extensive research has been conducted to identify malicious domains based on their unique behavior reflected in different phases of the life cycle of {DNS} queries and responses. Existing approaches differ significantly in terms of intuitions, data analysis methods as well as evaluation methodologies. This warrants a thorough systematization of the approaches and a careful review of the advantages and limitations of every group. In this paper, we perform such an analysis. In order to achieve this goal, we present the necessary background knowledge on {DNS} and malicious activities leveraging {DNS}. We describe a general framework of malicious domain detection techniques using {DNS} data. Applying this framework, we categorize existing approaches using several orthogonal viewpoints, namely (1) sources of {DNS} data and their enrichment, (2) data analysis methods, and (3) evaluation strategies and metrics. In each aspect, we discuss the important challenges that the research community should address in order to fully realize the power of {DNS} data analysis to fight against attacks leveraging malicious domains.},

Some such networks display a natural bipartite structure: two kinds of nodes coexist with links only between nodes of different kinds. This bipartite structure has not been deeply studied until now, mainly because it appeared to be specific to only a few complex networks. However, we show here that all complex networks can be viewed as bipartite structures sharing some important statistics, like degree distributions. The basic properties of complex networks can be viewed as consequences of this underlying bipartite structure. This leads us to propose the first simple and intuitive model for complex networks which captures the main properties met in practice.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.3127},
	shorttitle = {Norm-Product Belief Propagation},
	abstract = {Inference problems in graphical models can be represented as a constrained optimization of a free energy function. In this paper we treat both forms of probabilistic inference, estimating marginal probabilities of the joint distribution and ﬁnding the most probable assignment, through a uniﬁed messagepassing algorithm architecture. In particular we generalize the Belief Propagation ({BP}) algorithms of sum-product and maxproduct and tree-rewaighted ({TRW}) sum and max product algorithms ({TRBP}) and introduce a new set of convergent algorithms based on ”convex-free-energy” and Linear-Programming ({LP}) relaxation as a zero-temprature of a convex-free-energy. The main idea of this work arises from taking a general perspective on the existing {BP} and {TRBP} algorithms while observing that they all are reductions from the basic optimization formula of f + i hi where the function f is an extended-valued, strictly convex but non-smooth and the functions hi are extended-valued functions (not necessarily convex). We use tools from convex duality to present the ”primal-dual ascent” algorithm which is an extension of the Bregman successive projection scheme and is designed to handle optimization of the general type f + i hi. We then map the fractional-free-energy variational principle for approximate inference onto the optimization formula above and introduce the ”norm-product” message-passing algorithm. Special cases of the norm-product include sum-product and max-product ({BP} algorithms), {TRBP} and {NMPLP} algorithms. When the fractionalfree-energy is set to be convex (convex-free-energy) the normproduct is globally convergent for the estimation of marginal probabilities and for approximating the {LP}-relaxation. We also introduce another branch of the norm-product which arises as the ”zero-temerature” of the convex-free-energy which we refer to as the ”convex-max-product”. The convex-max-product is convergent (unlike max-product) and aims at solving the {LPrelaxation}.},

	abstract = {An important part of problems in statistical physics and computer science can be expressed as the computation of marginal probabilities over a Markov Random Field. The belief propagation algorithm, which is an exact procedure to compute these marginals when the underlying graph is a tree, has gained its popularity as an eﬃcient way to approximate them in the more general case. In this paper, we focus on an aspect of the algorithm that did not get that much attention in the literature, which is the eﬀect of the normalization of the messages. We show in particular that, for a large class of normalization strategies, it is possible to focus only on belief convergence. Following this, we express the necessary and suﬃcient conditions for local stability of a ﬁxed point in terms of the graph structure and the beliefs values at the ﬁxed point. We also explicit some connexion between the normalization constants and the underlying Bethe Free Energy.},
